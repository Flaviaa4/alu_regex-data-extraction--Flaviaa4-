 # alu_regex-data-extraction--Flaviaa4-
This is a project that demonstrates the use of Regular Expressions (Regex), with the use of JavaScript to be implemented.
I started by declaring a variable with some properties like (Phone,url) with their regular expressions literal, which will be used in the execution of the project. 
I created a function called (regMatches) that will be called during implementation and everywhere with a Return, which is supposed to search a piece of text using a regular expression.
Later, I continued with writing test texts, which will be used to test if the expressions work well.
Then, after I used console.log for debugging and displaying information that I put in it.
